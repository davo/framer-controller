# Controller

A `Controller` maintains state for an arbitrary set of properties.

When a controller is created, all properties passed into its constructor will be stored in state.

| Property  | Type   | Description                                 |
| :-------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------ |
| state     | object | The controller's current state.             |
| connected | any    | Any data stored using the `connect` method. |

| Method          | Description                                                          |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| setState(state) | Merges the provided values into the controller's `state`.            |
| connect(data)   | Stores the provided `data` as the controller's `connected` property. |
| reset()         | Resets the controller to its initial state.                          |

In addition, the `Controller` class has three `protected` life cycle methods. If you're writing a class that extends `Controller`, you can overwrite these methods in your class.

| Protected Method                        | Description                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onUpdate(state: State, connected: any)  | A lifecycle method fired when the controller's state updates.  |
| onConnect(state: State, connected: any) | A lifecycle method fired when the controller connects to data. |
| onReset(state: State, connected: any)   | A lifecycle method fired when the controller resets its state. |

Example:

```tsx
const controller = new Controller({
	darkMode: false,
})

const Interface: Override = () => ({
	darkMode: controller.state.darkMode,
})

const ToggleModeButton: Override = () => ({
	onClick: () => {
		const { darkMode } = controller.state
		controller.setState({
			darkMode = !darkMode,
		})
	},
})
```
